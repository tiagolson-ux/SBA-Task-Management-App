Reflection (by-TN)
I had to completed this app in small, testable mini steps. First, I created the repo and base files, then wired up the HTML form, filters, counts, and table layout. Next, I hat to designed a simple data model—an array of task objects—persisted with localStorage, plus helper functions to load/save and compare ISO dates for deadlines. I also added form and filter event listeners, rendered the table dynamically from state, and used frequent console.log checks to confirm each action (add, update, delete, filter) worked as expected. The auto-overdue feature compares each task’s deadline to today and updates statuses during render and on an interval to stay accurate. My biggest challenge was keeping UI, filters, and data in sync; I solved this by centralizing updates in a single render() and keeping functions small and focused. If I had more time, I’d add edit-in-place, category chips, CSV import/export, and unit tests for helpers. This process strengthened my DOM, array/object, and persistence skills.
